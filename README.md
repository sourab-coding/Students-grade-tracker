# Students-grade-tracker
This JavaScript functionality tracks and analyzes the grades of a group of students. 
1. Calculates the Class Average: It computes the average grade of all students by summing their grades and dividing by the total number of students.
2. Finds the Highest Grade: Using the reduce() method, it identifies the student with the highest grade in the class.
3. Lists Students with High Scores: It filters out students who scored above 50 and maps them to a message of encouragement: "Good work!"
4. Lists Students Needing Improvement: It filters out students who scored below 50 and provides a motivational message: "Next time, work harder!"
